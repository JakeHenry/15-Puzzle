		<h2>Buttons</h2>
		<li>Solve - Will return the table to the solved state.</li>
		<li>New Game - Will create a new scrambled table for the user to
			solve.</li>
		<li>Directions - Will open the page you are reading which
			contains directions for the game.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul id="ul2">
		<h2>How To Play</h2>
		<li>Click on 'New Game' to scramble the table and start a new
			game!</li>
		<li>Click on numbers that are directly next to the blank space to
			slide the number into that space.</li>
		<li>Slide all numbers around so that they are in increasing
			numerical order. i.e. 1st row: 1 2 3 4 etc.</li>
		<li>Tip: To see what a solved game looks like, or if you just
			give up, click the 'solve' button or refresh the page!</li>
		<li>Another Tip: If the first three rows are complete and the
			last row reads 13 15 14, the game cannot be solved! Its not your
			fault! During the scrambling of the table, an illegal move must have
			been made. e.g. Peeling off the stickers of a Rubik's Cube to solve
			it.</li>
